# Bank Customer Churn Prediction Project

This project predicts bank customer churn (whether a customer will leave the bank or not) using machine learning models such as XGBoost, LightGBM, and CatBoost. The notebook includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, and model evaluation to identify the most effective approach for churn prediction.

## 📌 Project Overview

**Goal:** Predict customer churn using historical banking data.

**Techniques Used:**
- Preprocessing and Feature Engineering  
- Feature Scaling and One Hot Encoding (OHE)  
- Model Training with XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost  
- Model Comparison & Evaluation  

**Best Model Accuracy:** ~78.57%


## ⚙️ Installation

Clone the repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/your-username/bank-churn-prediction.git
cd bank-churn-prediction
```
---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Place the dataset in the `data/` folder.  
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

jupyter notebook bank-churn-prediction.ipynb


3. Run all cells to:
   - Preprocess data  
   - Train machine learning models  
   - Evaluate churn prediction performance  

---

## 📊 Results

- Applied **Feature Engineering** to handle correlation among 60+ features.  
- Used **OHE and Scaling** for categorical and numerical data.  
- Achieved **78.57% accuracy** using ensemble learning models.  

---

## 🔮 Future Improvements

- Hyperparameter tuning for better accuracy.  
- Adding deep learning models (e.g., Neural Networks).  
- Deploying as an interactive **Streamlit app or Flask API**.  
- Improving dataset balance with **SMOTE** or other techniques.
